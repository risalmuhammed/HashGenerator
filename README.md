# HashGenerator
A Tool to generate hashes and checksums.

A while back i wrote a command line tool in _Python3_ for generating different hashes.

Then i thought that it would be good if i made it GUI tool. Made use of the _Tkinter_ to build the GUI.

##Hashes include :

* MD5
* MD4
* SHA1
* SHA224
* SHA256
* SHA384
* SHA512
* RIPEMD160
* CRC32
* ADLER32
* DSA
* WHIRLPOOL

TODO: Add Tiger, Gost, Haval etc. ~~and Generate all for file too.~~

##Changelog:

- Added support for generating hashes of files.
- Slightely faster
